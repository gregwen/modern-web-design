            <h3>Article III</h3>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Three_of_the_United_States_Constitution" target="_blank"
                    alt="Article III of the U.S. Constitution">Article III</a> describes the court system (the judicial
                branch), including the Supreme Court. The article describes the kinds of cases the court takes as
                original jurisdiction. Congress can create lower courts and an appeals to trial by jury in all criminal
                cases, and defines the crime of treason.</p>

            <p>Section 1 vests the judicial power of the United States in federal courts, and with it, the authority to
                interpret and apply the law to a particular case. Also included is the power to punish, sentence, and
                direct future action to resolve conflicts. The Constitution outlines the U.S. judicial system. In the
                <em>Judiciary Act of 1789</em>, Congress began to fill in details. Currently, Title 28 of the U.S. Code
                describes judicial powers and administration.
            </p>

            <p>As of the First Congress, the Supreme Court justices rode circuit to sit as panels to hear appeals from
                the district courts. In 1891, Congress enacted a new system. District courts would have original
                jurisdiction. Intermediate appellate courts (circuit courts) with exclusive jurisdiction heard regional
                appeals before consideration by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court holds discretionary jurisdiction,
                meaning that it does not have to hear every case that is brought to it.</p>

            <p>To enforce judicial decisions, the Constitution grants federal courts both criminal contempt and civil
                contempt powers. Other implied powers include injunctive relief and the habeas corpus remedy. The Court
                may imprison for contumacy, bad-faith litigation, and failure to obey a writ of mandamus. Judicial power
                includes that granted by Acts of Congress for rules of law and punishment. Judicial power also extends
                to areas not covered by statute. Generally, federal courts cannot interrupt state court proceedings.</p>

            <p>Clause 1 of Section 2 authorizes the federal courts to hear actual cases and controversies only. Their
                judicial power does not extend to cases that are hypothetical, or which are proscribed due to standing,
                mootness, or ripeness issues. Generally, a case or controversy requires the presence of adverse parties
                who have some interest genuinely at stake in the case.</p>

            <p>Clause 2 of Section 2 provides that the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in cases involving
                ambassadors, ministers, and consuls, for all cases respecting foreign nation-states, and also in those
                controversies which are subject to federal judicial power because at least one state is a party. Cases
                arising under the laws of the United States and its treaties come under the jurisdiction of federal
                courts. Cases under international maritime law and conflicting land grants of different states come
                under federal courts. Cases between U.S. citizens in different states, and cases between U.S. citizens
                and foreign states and their citizens, come under federal jurisdiction. The trials will be in the state
                where the crime was committed.</p>

            <p>No part of the Constitution expressly authorizes judicial review, but the Framers did contemplate the
                idea, and precedent has since established that the courts could exercise judicial review over the
                actions of Congress or the executive branch. Two conflicting federal laws are under "pendent"
                jurisdiction if one presents a strict constitutional issue. Federal court jurisdiction is rare when a
                state legislature enacts something as under federal jurisdiction. To establish a federal system of
                national law, considerable effort goes into developing a spirit of comity between federal government and
                states. By the doctrine of 'Res judicata', federal courts give "full faith and credit" to State Courts.
                The Supreme Court will decide Constitutional issues of state law only on a case-by-case basis, and only
                by strict Constitutional necessity, independent of state legislators' motives, their policy outcomes or
                its national wisdom.</p>

            <p>Section 3 bars Congress from changing or modifying Federal law on treason by simple majority statute.
                This section also defines treason, as an overt act of making war or materially helping those at war with
                the United States. Accusations must be corroborated by at least two witnesses. Congress is a political
                body and political disagreements routinely encountered should never be considered as treason. This
                allows for nonviolent resistance to the government because opposition is not a life or death
                proposition. However, Congress does provide for other lesser subversive crimes such as conspiracy.</p>
