            <h3>Article II</h3>
            <p>Article II describes the office, qualifications, and duties of the President of the United States
                and the
                Vice President. The President is head of the executive branch of the federal government, as well
                as the
                nation's head of state and head of government.</p>

            <p>Article two is modified by the 12th Amendment which tacitly acknowledges political parties, and
                the 25th
                Amendment relating to office succession. The president is to receive only one compensation from
                the federal
                government. The inaugural oath is specified to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.
            </p>

            <p>The president is the Commander in Chief of the United States Armed Forces, as well as of state
                militias when
                they are mobilized. The president makes treaties with the advice and consent of a two-thirds
                quorum of the
                Senate. To administer the federal government, the president commissions all the offices of the
                federal
                government as Congress directs; and may require the opinions of its principal officers and make
                "recess
                appointments" for vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate. The president
                ensures the laws
                are faithfully executed and may grant reprieves and pardons with the exception of Congressional
                impeachment.
                The president reports to Congress on the State of the Union, and by the Recommendation Clause,
                recommends
                "necessary and expedient" national measures. The president may convene and adjourn Congress
                under special
                circumstances.</p>

            <p>Section 4 provides for the removal of the president and other federal officers. The president is
                removed on
                impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.</p>
