    <summary>Article III</summary>
    <p>Article III describes the court system (the judicial branch), including the Supreme Court. The
        article
        describes
        the kinds of cases the court takes as original jurisdiction. Congress can create lower courts
        and an appeals
        process, and enacts law defining crimes and punishments. Article Three also protects the right
        to trial by
        jury
        in all criminal cases, and defines the crime of treason.</p>

    <p>Section 1 vests the judicial power of the United States in federal courts, and with it, the
        authority to
        interpret and apply the law to a particular case. Also included is the power to punish,
        sentence, and direct
        future action to resolve conflicts. The Constitution outlines the U.S. judicial system. In the
        Judiciary Act
        of
        1789, Congress began to fill in details. Currently, Title 28 of the U.S. Code[84] describes
        judicial powers
        and
        administration.</p>

    <p>As of the First Congress, the Supreme Court justices rode circuit to sit as panels to hear
        appeals from the
        district courts. In 1891, Congress enacted a new system. District courts would have original
        jurisdiction.
        Intermediate appellate courts (circuit courts) with exclusive jurisdiction heard regional
        appeals before
        consideration by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court holds discretionary jurisdiction, meaning
        that it does
        not
        have to hear every case that is brought to it.</p>

    <p>To enforce judicial decisions, the Constitution grants federal courts both criminal contempt and
        civil
        contempt
        powers. Other implied powers include injunctive relief and the habeas corpus remedy. The Court
        may imprison
        for
        contumacy, bad-faith litigation, and failure to obey a writ of mandamus. Judicial power includes
        that
        granted by
        Acts of Congress for rules of law and punishment. Judicial power also extends to areas not
        covered by
        statute.
        Generally, federal courts cannot interrupt state court proceedings.</p>

    <p>Clause 1 of Section 2 authorizes the federal courts to hear actual cases and controversies only.
        Their
        judicial
        power does not extend to cases that are hypothetical, or which are proscribed due to standing,
        mootness, or
        ripeness issues. Generally, a case or controversy requires the presence of adverse parties who
        have some
        interest genuinely at stake in the case.</p>

    <p>ng ambassadors,
        ministers, and consuls, for all cases respecting foreign nation-states, and also in those
        controversies
        which are subject to federal judicial power because at least one state is a party. Cases arising
        under the
        laws
        of the United States and its treaties come under the jurisdiction of federal courts. Cases under
        international
        maritime law and conflicting land grants of different states come under federal courts. Cases
        between U.S.
        citizens in different states, and cases between U.S. citizens and foreign states and their
        citizens, come
        under
        federal jurisdiction. The trials will be in the state where the crime was committed.</p>

    <p>No part of the Constitution expressly authorizes judicial review, but the Framers did contemplate
        the idea,
        and
        precedent has since established that the courts could exercise judicial review over the actions
        of Congress
        or
        the executive branch. Two conflicting federal laws are under "pendent" jurisdiction if one
        presents a strict
        constitutional issue. Federal court jurisdiction is rare when a state legislature enacts
        something as under
        federal jurisdiction. To establish a federal system of national law, considerable effort goes
        into
        developing
        a spirit of comity between federal government and states. By the doctrine of 'Res judicata',
        federal courts
        give
        "full faith and credit" to State Courts.[h] The Supreme Court will decide Constitutional issues
        of state law
        only on a case-by-case basis, and only by strict Constitutional necessity, independent of state
        legislators'
        motives, their policy outcomes or its national wisdom.</p>

    <p>Section 3 bars Congress from changing or modifying Federal law on treason by simple majority
        statute. This
        section also defines treason, as an overt act of making war or materially helping those at war
        with the
        United
        States. Accusations must be corroborated by at least two witnesses. Congress is a political body
        and
        political
        disagreements routinely encountered should never be considered as treason. This allows for
        nonviolent
        resistance
        to the government because opposition is not a life or death proposition. However, Congress does
        provide for
        other lesser subversive crimes such as conspiracy.</p>

            <p><strong>The Constitution of the United States</strong> is the supreme law of the United States of
                America. It
                superseded the <em>Articles of Confederation</em>, the nation's first constitution, in 1789. Originally
                comprising seven articles, it delineates the national frame and constraints of government. Its first
                three
                articles embody the doctrine of the separation of powers, whereby the federal government is divided into
                three branches:</p>

            <ul>
                <li class="navigation">Article 1: Legislative Branch</li>
                <li class="navigation">Article 2: Executive Branch</li>
                <li class="navigation">Article 3: Judicial Branch</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Article IV, Article V, and Article VI embody concepts of federalism, describing the rights and
                responsibilities of state governments, the states in relationship to the federal government, and the
                shared
                process of constitutional amendment. Article VII establishes the procedure subsequently used by the 13
                states to ratify it. The Constitution of the United States is the oldest and longest-standing written
                and
                codified national constitution in force in the world today.</p>

            </aside>

            <p>Since the constitution was ratified in 1789, it has been amended 27 times. The first ten amendments,
                known
                collectively as the Bill of Rights, offer specific protections of individual liberty and justice and
                place
                restrictions on the powers of government within the U.S. states. The majority of the 17 later amendments
                expand individual civil rights protections. Others address issues related to federal authority or modify
                government processes and procedures. Amendments to the United States Constitution, unlike ones made to
                many
                constitutions worldwide, are appended to the document.</p>

            <p>The original U.S. Constitution was written on five pages of parchment. The first permanent constitution,
                it
                is interpreted, supplemented, and implemented by a large body of federal constitutional law, and has
                influenced the constitutions of other nations.</p>
