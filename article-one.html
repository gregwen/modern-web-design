    <summary>Article I: Legislative Branch</summary>
    <p>Article I describes the Congress, the legislative branch of the federal government. Section 1,
        reads, <q>All
            legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which
            shall
            consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.</q> The article establishes the manner of
        election and
        the qualifications of members of each body. Representatives must be at least 25 years old, be a
        citizen of
        the United States for seven years, and live in the state they represent. Senators must be at
        least 30 years
        old, be a citizen for nine years, and live in the state they represent.</p>

    <p>Article I, Section 8 enumerates the powers delegated to the legislature. Financially, Congress
        has the power
        to tax, borrow, pay debt and provide for the common defense and the general welfare; to regulate
        commerce,
        bankruptcies, and coin money. To regulate internal affairs, it has the power to regulate and
        govern military
        forces and militias, suppress insurrections and repel invasions. It is to provide for
        naturalization,
        standards of weights and measures, post offices and roads, and patents; to directly govern the
        federal
        district and cessions of land by the states for forts and arsenals. Internationally, Congress
        has the power
        to define and punish piracies and offenses against the Law of Nations, to declare war and make
        rules of war.
        The final Necessary and Proper Clause, also known as the Elastic Clause, expressly confers
        incidental powers
        upon Congress without the Articles' requirement for express delegation for each and every power.
        Article I,
        Section 9 lists eight specific limits on congressional power.</p>

    <p>The Supreme Court has sometimes broadly interpreted the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and
        Proper Clause
        in Article One to allow Congress to enact legislation that is neither expressly allowed by the
        enumerated
        powers nor expressly denied in the limitations on Congress. In McCulloch v. Maryland (1819), the
        Supreme
        Court read the Necessary and Proper Clause to permit the federal government to take action that
        would
        "enable [it] to perform the high duties assigned to it [by the Constitution] in the manner most
        beneficial
        to the people", even if that action is not itself within the enumerated powers. Chief Justice
        Marshall
        clarified: <q>Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the Constitution, and all
            means which
            are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but
            consist with the
            letter and spirit of the Constitution, are Constitutional.</q></p>

            <p><strong>The Constitution of the United States</strong> is the supreme law of the United States of
                America. It
                superseded the <em>Articles of Confederation</em>, the nation's first constitution, in 1789. Originally
                comprising seven articles, it delineates the national frame and constraints of government. Its first
                three
                articles embody the doctrine of the separation of powers, whereby the federal government is divided into
                three branches:</p>

            <ul>
                <li class="navigation">Article 1: Legislative Branch</li>
                <li class="navigation">Article 2: Executive Branch</li>
                <li class="navigation">Article 3: Judicial Branch</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Article IV, Article V, and Article VI embody concepts of federalism, describing the rights and
                responsibilities of state governments, the states in relationship to the federal government, and the
                shared
                process of constitutional amendment. Article VII establishes the procedure subsequently used by the 13
                states to ratify it. The Constitution of the United States is the oldest and longest-standing written
                and
                codified national constitution in force in the world today.</p>

            </aside>

            <p>Since the constitution was ratified in 1789, it has been amended 27 times. The first ten amendments,
                known
                collectively as the Bill of Rights, offer specific protections of individual liberty and justice and
                place
                restrictions on the powers of government within the U.S. states. The majority of the 17 later amendments
                expand individual civil rights protections. Others address issues related to federal authority or modify
                government processes and procedures. Amendments to the United States Constitution, unlike ones made to
                many
                constitutions worldwide, are appended to the document.</p>

            <p>The original U.S. Constitution was written on five pages of parchment. The first permanent constitution,
                it
                is interpreted, supplemented, and implemented by a large body of federal constitutional law, and has
                influenced the constitutions of other nations.</p>
