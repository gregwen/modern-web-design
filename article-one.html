            <p>Article I describes the Congress, the legislative branch of the federal government. Section 1,
                reads, <q>All
                    legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which
                    shall
                    consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.</q> The article establishes the manner of
                election and
                the qualifications of members of each body. Representatives must be at least 25 years old, be a
                citizen of
                the United States for seven years, and live in the state they represent. Senators must be at
                least 30 years
                old, be a citizen for nine years, and live in the state they represent.</p>

            <p>Article I, Section 8 enumerates the powers delegated to the legislature. Financially, Congress
                has the power
                to tax, borrow, pay debt and provide for the common defense and the general welfare; to regulate
                commerce,
                bankruptcies, and coin money. To regulate internal affairs, it has the power to regulate and
                govern military
                forces and militias, suppress insurrections and repel invasions. It is to provide for
                naturalization,
                standards of weights and measures, post offices and roads, and patents; to directly govern the
                federal
                district and cessions of land by the states for forts and arsenals. Internationally, Congress
                has the power
                to define and punish piracies and offenses against the Law of Nations, to declare war and make
                rules of war.
                The final Necessary and Proper Clause, also known as the Elastic Clause, expressly confers
                incidental powers
                upon Congress without the Articles' requirement for express delegation for each and every power.
                Article I,
                Section 9 lists eight specific limits on congressional power.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has sometimes broadly interpreted the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and
                Proper Clause
                in Article One to allow Congress to enact legislation that is neither expressly allowed by the
                enumerated
                powers nor expressly denied in the limitations on Congress. In McCulloch v. Maryland (1819), the
                Supreme
                Court read the Necessary and Proper Clause to permit the federal government to take action that
                would
                "enable [it] to perform the high duties assigned to it [by the Constitution] in the manner most
                beneficial
                to the people", even if that action is not itself within the enumerated powers. Chief Justice
                Marshall
                clarified:</p> 
                
                <blockquote>Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the Constitution, and all
                means which
                are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but
                consist with the
                letter and spirit of the Constitution, are Constitutional.</blockquote>
