          <p><strong>The Constitution of the United States</strong> is the supreme law of the United States of America. It superseded the <em>Articles of Confederation</em>, the nation's first constitution, in 1789. Originally comprising seven articles, it delineates the national frame and constraints of government. Its first three articles embody the doctrine of the separation of powers, whereby the federal government is divided into three branches:</p>

          <ul>
            <li class="list">Article I: Legislative Branch</li>
            <li class="list">Article II: Executive Branch</li>
            <li class="list">Article III: Judicial Branch</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Article IV, Article V, and Article VI embody concepts of federalism, describing the rights and responsibilities of state governments, the states in relationship to the federal government, and the shared process of constitutional amendment. Article VII establishes the procedure subsequently used by the 13 states to ratify it. The Constitution of the United States is the oldest and longest-standing written and codified national constitution in force in the world today.</p>

          <p>Since the constitution was ratified in 1789, it has been amended 27 times. The first ten amendments, known collectively as the Bill of Rights, offer specific protections of individual liberty and justice and place restrictions on the powers of government within the U.S. states. The majority of the 17 later amendments expand individual civil rights protections. Others address issues related to federal authority or modify government processes and procedures. Amendments to the United States Constitution, unlike ones made to many constitutions worldwide, are appended to the document.</p>

          <p>The original U.S. Constitution was written on five pages of parchment. The first permanent constitution, it is interpreted, supplemented, and implemented by a large body of federal constitutional law, and has influenced the constitutions of other nations.</p>
