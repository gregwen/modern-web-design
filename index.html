		<h1 class="title">The Constitution of the United States</h1>
	</header>
	<main>
		<p><strong>The Constitution of the United States</strong> is the supreme law of the United States of America. It
			superseded the <em>Articles of Confederation</em>, the nation's first constitution, in 1789. Originally
			comprising seven articles, it delineates the national frame and constraints of government. Its first three
			articles embody the doctrine of the separation of powers, whereby the federal government is divided into
			three branches:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Article I - The Legislative, consisting of the bicameral Congress;</li>
			<li>Article II - The Executive, consisting of the president and subordinate officers;</li>
			<li>Article III - The Judicial, consisting of the Supreme Court and other federal courts;</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Article IV, Article V, and Article VI embody concepts of federalism, describing the rights and
			responsibilities of state governments, the states in relationship to the federal government, and the shared
			process of constitutional amendment. Article VII establishes the procedure subsequently used by the 13
			states to ratify it. The Constitution of the United States is the oldest and longest-standing written and
			codified national constitution in force in the world today.</p>

		<p>Since the constitution was ratified in 1789, it has been amended 27 times. The first ten amendments, known
			collectively as the Bill of Rights, offer specific protections of individual liberty and justice and place
			restrictions on the powers of government within the U.S. states. The majority of the 17 later amendments
			expand individual civil rights protections. Others address issues related to federal authority or modify
			government processes and procedures. Amendments to the United States Constitution, unlike ones made to many
			constitutions worldwide, are appended to the document.</p>

		<p>The original U.S. Constitution was written on five pages of parchment. The first permanent constitution, it
			is interpreted, supplemented, and implemented by a large body of federal constitutional law, and has
			influenced the constitutions of other nations.</p>


		<h4>Article I</h4>
		<p>Article I describes the Congress, the legislative branch of the federal government. Section 1, reads, <q>All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.</q> The article establishes the manner of election and the qualifications of members of each body. Representatives must be at least 25 years old, be a citizen of the United States for seven years, and live in the state they represent. Senators must be at least 30 years old, be a citizen for nine years, and live in the state they represent.</p>

		<p>Article I, Section 8 enumerates the powers delegated to the legislature. Financially, Congress has the power to tax, borrow, pay debt and provide for the common defense and the general welfare; to regulate commerce, bankruptcies, and coin money. To regulate internal affairs, it has the power to regulate and govern military forces and militias, suppress insurrections and repel invasions. It is to provide for naturalization, standards of weights and measures, post offices and roads, and patents; to directly govern the federal district and cessions of land by the states for forts and arsenals. Internationally, Congress has the power to define and punish piracies and offenses against the Law of Nations, to declare war and make rules of war. The final Necessary and Proper Clause, also known as the Elastic Clause, expressly confers incidental powers upon Congress without the Articles' requirement for express delegation for each and every power. Article I, Section 9 lists eight specific limits on congressional power.</p>

		<p>The Supreme Court has sometimes broadly interpreted the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause
			in Article One to allow Congress to enact legislation that is neither expressly allowed by the enumerated
			powers nor expressly denied in the limitations on Congress. In McCulloch v. Maryland (1819), the Supreme
			Court read the Necessary and Proper Clause to permit the federal government to take action that would
			"enable [it] to perform the high duties assigned to it [by the Constitution] in the manner most beneficial
			to the people", even if that action is not itself within the enumerated powers. Chief Justice Marshall clarified: <q>Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the Constitution, are Constitutional.</q></p>

		<h4>Article II</h4>
		<p>Article II describes the office, qualifications, and duties of the President of the United States and the Vice President. The President is head of the executive branch of the federal government, as well as the nation's head of state and head of government.</p>

		<p>Article two is modified by the 12th Amendment which tacitly acknowledges political parties, and the 25th Amendment relating to office succession. The president is to receive only one compensation from the federal government. The inaugural oath is specified to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.</p>

		<p>The president is the Commander in Chief of the United States Armed Forces, as well as of state militias when they are mobilized. The president makes treaties with the advice and consent of a two-thirds quorum of the Senate. To administer the federal government, the president commissions all the offices of the federal government as Congress directs; and may require the opinions of its principal officers and make "recess appointments" for vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate. The president ensures the laws are faithfully executed and may grant reprieves and pardons with the exception of Congressional impeachment. The president reports to Congress on the State of the Union, and by the Recommendation Clause, recommends "necessary and expedient" national measures. The president may convene and adjourn Congress under special circumstances.</p>

		<p>Section 4 provides for the removal of the president and other federal officers. The president is removed on
			impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.</p>

		<h4>Article III</h4>
		<p>Article III describes the court system (the judicial branch), including the Supreme Court. The article
			describes
			the kinds of cases the court takes as original jurisdiction. Congress can create lower courts and an appeals
			process, and enacts law defining crimes and punishments. Article Three also protects the right to trial by
			jury
			in all criminal cases, and defines the crime of treason.</p>

		<p>Section 1 vests the judicial power of the United States in federal courts, and with it, the authority to
			interpret and apply the law to a particular case. Also included is the power to punish, sentence, and direct
			future action to resolve conflicts. The Constitution outlines the U.S. judicial system. In the Judiciary Act
			of
			1789, Congress began to fill in details. Currently, Title 28 of the U.S. Code[84] describes judicial powers
			and
			administration.</p>

		<p>As of the First Congress, the Supreme Court justices rode circuit to sit as panels to hear appeals from the
			district courts. In 1891, Congress enacted a new system. District courts would have original
			jurisdiction.
			Intermediate appellate courts (circuit courts) with exclusive jurisdiction heard regional appeals before
			consideration by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court holds discretionary jurisdiction, meaning that it does
			not
			have to hear every case that is brought to it.</p>

		<p>To enforce judicial decisions, the Constitution grants federal courts both criminal contempt and civil
			contempt
			powers. Other implied powers include injunctive relief and the habeas corpus remedy. The Court may imprison
			for
			contumacy, bad-faith litigation, and failure to obey a writ of mandamus. Judicial power includes that
			granted by
			Acts of Congress for rules of law and punishment. Judicial power also extends to areas not covered by
			statute.
			Generally, federal courts cannot interrupt state court proceedings.</p>

		<p>Clause 1 of Section 2 authorizes the federal courts to hear actual cases and controversies only. Their
			judicial
			power does not extend to cases that are hypothetical, or which are proscribed due to standing, mootness, or
			ripeness issues. Generally, a case or controversy requires the presence of adverse parties who have some
			interest genuinely at stake in the case.</p>

		<p>ng ambassadors,
			ministers, and consuls, for all cases respecting foreign nation-states, and also in those controversies
			which are subject to federal judicial power because at least one state is a party. Cases arising under the
			laws
			of the United States and its treaties come under the jurisdiction of federal courts. Cases under
			international
			maritime law and conflicting land grants of different states come under federal courts. Cases between U.S.
			citizens in different states, and cases between U.S. citizens and foreign states and their citizens, come
			under
			federal jurisdiction. The trials will be in the state where the crime was committed.</p>

		<p>No part of the Constitution expressly authorizes judicial review, but the Framers did contemplate the idea,
			and
			precedent has since established that the courts could exercise judicial review over the actions of Congress
			or
			the executive branch. Two conflicting federal laws are under "pendent" jurisdiction if one presents a strict
			constitutional issue. Federal court jurisdiction is rare when a state legislature enacts something as under
			federal jurisdiction. To establish a federal system of national law, considerable effort goes into
			developing
			a spirit of comity between federal government and states. By the doctrine of 'Res judicata', federal courts
			give
			"full faith and credit" to State Courts.[h] The Supreme Court will decide Constitutional issues of state law
			only on a case-by-case basis, and only by strict Constitutional necessity, independent of state legislators'
			motives, their policy outcomes or its national wisdom.</p>

		<p>Section 3 bars Congress from changing or modifying Federal law on treason by simple majority statute. This
			section also defines treason, as an overt act of making war or materially helping those at war with the
			United
			States. Accusations must be corroborated by at least two witnesses. Congress is a political body and
			political
			disagreements routinely encountered should never be considered as treason. This allows for nonviolent
			resistance
			to the government because opposition is not a life or death proposition. However, Congress does provide for
			other lesser subversive crimes such as conspiracy.</p>
