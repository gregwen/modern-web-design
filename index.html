            <p><strong>The Constitution of the United States</strong> is the supreme law of the United States of
                America. It
                superseded the <em>Articles of Confederation</em>, the nation's first constitution, in 1789. Originally
                comprising seven articles, it delineates the national frame and constraints of government. Its first
                three
                articles embody the doctrine of the separation of powers, whereby the federal government is divided into
                three branches:</p>

            <ul>
                <li class="list">Article I: Legislative Branch</li>
                <li class="list">Article II: Executive Branch</li>
                <li class="list">Article III: Judicial Branch</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Article IV, Article V, and Article VI embody concepts of federalism, describing the rights and
                responsibilities of state governments, the states in relationship to the federal government, and the
                shared
                process of constitutional amendment. Article VII establishes the procedure subsequently used by the 13
                states to ratify it. The Constitution of the United States is the oldest and longest-standing written
                and
                codified national constitution in force in the world today.</p>

            <p>Since the constitution was ratified in 1789, it has been amended 27 times. The first ten amendments,
                known
                collectively as the Bill of Rights, offer specific protections of individual liberty and justice and
                place
                restrictions on the powers of government within the U.S. states. The majority of the 17 later amendments
                expand individual civil rights protections. Others address issues related to federal authority or modify
                government processes and procedures. Amendments to the United States Constitution, unlike ones made to
                many
                constitutions worldwide, are appended to the document.</p>

            <p>The original U.S. Constitution was written on five pages of parchment. The first permanent constitution,
                it is interpreted, supplemented, and implemented by a large body of federal constitutional law, and has
                influenced the constitutions of other nations.</p>
