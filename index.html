	<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Constitution of the United States</h1>
	<p><strong>The Constitution of the United States</strong> is the supreme law of the United States of America.[3] It superseded the Articles of Confederation, the nation's first constitution, in 1789. Originally comprising seven articles, it delineates the
	national frame and constraints of government. Its first three articles embody the doctrine of the separation of powers, whereby the federal government is divided into three branches: the legislative, consisting of the bicameral Congress
	(Article I); the executive, consisting of the president and subordinate officers (Article II); and the judicial, consisting of the Supreme Court and other federal courts (Article III). Article IV, Article V, and Article VI embody concepts of
	federalism, describing the rights and responsibilities of state governments, the states in relationship to the federal government, and the shared process of constitutional amendment. Article VII establishes the procedure subsequently used by
	the 13 states to ratify it. The Constitution of the United States is the oldest and longest-standing written and codified national constitution in force in the world today.[4][a]

	Since the constitution was ratified in 1789, it has been amended 27 times.[5][6] The first ten amendments, known collectively as the Bill of Rights, offer specific protections of individual liberty and justice and place restrictions on the
	powers of government within the U.S. states.[7][8] The majority of the 17 later amendments expand individual civil rights protections. Others address issues related to federal authority or modify government processes and procedures.
	Amendments to the United States Constitution, unlike ones made to many constitutions worldwide, are appended to the document. The original U.S. Constitution[9] was written on five pages of parchment.[10] The first permanent constitution,[b]
	it is interpreted, supplemented, and implemented by a large body of federal constitutional law, and has influenced the constitutions of other nations.

	Background
	See also: History of the United States Constitution
	First government
	From September 5, 1774, to March 1, 1781, the Continental Congress functioned as the provisional government of the United States. Delegates to the First (1774) and then the Second (1775–1781) Continental Congress were chosen largely through
	the action of committees of correspondence in various colonies rather than through the colonial governments of the Thirteen Colonies.[13]

	Articles of Confederation
	Main article: Articles of Confederation
	The Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union was the first constitution of the United States.[14] It was drafted by the Second Continental Congress from mid-1776 through late 1777, and ratification by all 13 states was completed by early
	1781. The Articles of Confederation gave little power to the central government. The Confederation Congress could make decisions but lacked enforcement powers. Implementation of most decisions, including modifications to the Articles,
	required unanimous approval of all 13 state legislatures.[15][16]

	Although, in a way, the Congressional powers in Article 9 made the "league of states as cohesive and strong as any similar sort of republican confederation in history",[17] the chief problem was, in the words of George Washington, "no
	money".[18] The Continental Congress could print money but it was worthless. Congress could borrow money but could not pay it back.[18] No state paid all their U.S. taxes; some paid nothing. A few paid an amount equal to interest on the
	national debt owed to their citizens, but no more. No interest was paid on debt owed foreign governments. By 1786, the United States would default on outstanding debts as their dates came due.[18]

	Internationally, the United States had little ability to defend its sovereignty. Most of the troops in the 625-man United States Army were deployed facing (but not threatening) British forts on American soil. They had not been paid; some were
	deserting and others threatening mutiny.[19] Spain closed New Orleans to American commerce; U.S. officials protested, but to no effect. Barbary pirates began seizing American ships of commerce; the Treasury had no funds to pay their ransom.
	If any military crisis required action, the Congress had no credit or taxing power to finance a response.[18]

	Domestically, the Articles of Confederation was failing to bring unity to the diverse sentiments and interests of the various states. Although the Treaty of Paris (1783) was signed between Great Britain and the U.S., and named each of the
	American states, various states proceeded to violate it. New York and South Carolina repeatedly prosecuted Loyalists for wartime activity and redistributed their lands.[18] Individual state legislatures independently laid embargoes,
	negotiated directly with foreign authorities, raised armies, and made war, all violating the letter and the spirit of the Articles.

	In September 1786, during an inter–state convention to discuss and develop a consensus about reversing the protectionist trade barriers that each state had erected, James Madison questioned whether the Articles of Confederation was a binding
	compact or even a viable government. Connecticut paid nothing and "positively refused" to pay U.S. assessments for two years.[20] A rumor had it that a "seditious party" of New York legislators had opened a conversation with the Viceroy of
	Canada. To the south, the British were said to be openly funding Creek Indian raids on Georgia, and the state was under martial law.[21] Additionally, during Shays' Rebellion (August 1786 – June 1787) in Massachusetts, Congress could provide
	no money to support an endangered constituent state. General Benjamin Lincoln was obliged to raise funds from Boston merchants to pay for a volunteer army.[22]

	Congress was paralyzed. It could do nothing significant without nine states, and some legislation required all 13. When a state produced only one member in attendance, its vote was not counted. If a state's delegation was evenly divided, its
	vote could not be counted towards the nine-count requirement.[23] The Congress of the Confederation had "virtually ceased trying to govern".[24] The vision of a "respectable nation" among nations seemed to be fading in the eyes of
	revolutionaries such as George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Rufus King. Their dream of a republic, a nation without hereditary rulers, with power derived from the people in frequent elections, was in doubt.[25][26]

	On February 21, 1787, the Confederation Congress called a convention of state delegates at Philadelphia to propose revisions to the Articles.[27] Unlike earlier attempts, the convention was not meant for new laws or piecemeal alterations, but
	for the "sole and express purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation". The convention was not limited to commerce; rather, it was intended to "render the federal constitution adequate to the exigencies of government and the
	preservation of the Union." The proposal might take effect when approved by Congress and the states.[28]

	1787 drafting
	Main articles: Constitutional Convention (United States) and James Madison as Father of the Constitution

	Signing of the Constitution, September 17, 1787 (1940 by Howard Chandler Christy)
	On the appointed day, May 14, 1787, only the Virginia and Pennsylvania delegations were present, and so the convention's opening meeting was postponed for lack of a quorum.[29] A quorum of seven states met and deliberations began on May 25.
	Eventually twelve states were represented; 74 delegates were named, 55 attended and 39 signed.[30] The delegates were generally convinced that an effective central government with a wide range of enforceable powers must replace the weaker
	Congress established by the Articles of Confederation.

	Two plans for structuring the federal government arose at the convention's outset:

	The Virginia Plan (also known as the Large State Plan or the Randolph Plan) proposed that the legislative department of the national government be composed of a Bicameral Congress, with both chambers elected with apportionment according to
	population. Generally favoring the most highly populated states, it used the philosophy of John Locke to rely on consent of the governed, Montesquieu for divided government, and Edward Coke to emphasize civil liberties.[31]
	The New Jersey Plan proposed that the legislative department be a unicameral body with one vote per state. Generally favoring the less-populous states, it used the philosophy of English Whigs such as Edmund Burke to rely on received procedure
	and William Blackstone to emphasize sovereignty of the legislature. This position reflected the belief that the states were independent entities and, as they entered the United States of America freely and individually, remained so.[32]
	On May 31, the Convention devolved into a "Committee of the Whole" to consider the Virginia Plan. On June 13, the Virginia resolutions in amended form were reported out of committee. The New Jersey Plan was put forward in response to the
	Virginia Plan.

	A "Committee of Eleven" (one delegate from each state represented) met from July 2 to 16[33] to work out a compromise on the issue of representation in the federal legislature. All agreed to a republican form of government grounded in
	representing the people in the states. For the legislature, two issues were to be decided: how the votes were to be allocated among the states in the Congress, and how the representatives should be elected. In its report, now known as the
	Connecticut Compromise (or "Great Compromise"), the committee proposed proportional representation for seats in the House of Representatives based on population (with the people voting for representatives), and equal representation for each
	State in the Senate (with each state's legislators generally choosing their respective senators), and that all money bills would originate in the House.[34]

	The Great Compromise ended the stalemate between "patriots" and "nationalists", leading to numerous other compromises in a spirit of accommodation. There were sectional interests to be balanced by the Three-Fifths Compromise; reconciliation
	on Presidential term, powers, and method of selection; and jurisdiction of the federal judiciary.

	On July 24, a "Committee of Detail"—John Rutledge (South Carolina), Edmund Randolph (Virginia), Nathaniel Gorham (Massachusetts), Oliver Ellsworth (Connecticut), and James Wilson (Pennsylvania)—was elected to draft a detailed constitution
	reflective of the Resolutions passed by the convention up to that point.[35] The Convention recessed from July 26 to August 6 to await the report of this "Committee of Detail". Overall, the report of the committee conformed to the resolutions
	adopted by the convention, adding some elements. A twenty-three article (plus preamble) constitution was presented.[36]

	From August 6 to September 10, the report of the committee of detail was discussed, section by section and clause by clause. Details were attended to, and further compromises were effected.[33][35] Toward the close of these discussions, on
	September 8, a "Committee of Style and Arrangement"—Alexander Hamilton (New York), William Samuel Johnson (Connecticut), Rufus King (Massachusetts), James Madison (Virginia), and Gouverneur Morris (Pennsylvania)—was appointed to distill a
	final draft constitution from the twenty-three approved articles.[35] The final draft, presented to the convention on September 12, contained seven articles, a preamble and a closing endorsement, of which Morris was the primary author.[30]
	The committee also presented a proposed letter to accompany the constitution when delivered to Congress.[37]

	The final document, engrossed by Jacob Shallus,[38] was taken up on Monday, September 17, at the convention's final session. Several of the delegates were disappointed in the result, a makeshift series of unfortunate compromises. Some
	delegates left before the ceremony and three others refused to sign. Of the thirty-nine signers, Benjamin Franklin summed up, addressing the convention: "There are several parts of this Constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am
	not sure I shall never approve them." He would accept the Constitution, "because I expect no better and because I am not sure that it is not the best".[39]

	The advocates of the Constitution were anxious to obtain unanimous support of all twelve states represented in the convention. Their accepted formula for the closing endorsement was "Done in Convention, by the unanimous consent of the States
	present." At the end of the convention, the proposal was agreed to by eleven state delegations and the lone remaining delegate from New York, Alexander Hamilton.[40]

	Ratification by the states
	Further information: History of the United States Constitution § Ratification of the Constitution

	Dates the 13 states ratified the Constitution
	Within three days of its signing on September 17, 1787, the Constitution was submitted to the Congress of the Confederation, then sitting in New York City, the nation's temporary capital.[41][42][43] The document, originally intended as a
	revision of the Articles of Confederation, instead introduced a completely new form of government.[44][45][46] While members of Congress had the power to reject it, they voted unanimously on September 28 to forward the proposal to the
	thirteen states for their ratification.[47][48] Under the process outlined in Article VII of the proposed Constitution, the state legislatures were tasked with organizing "Federal Conventions" to ratify the document. This scheme ignored the
	amendment process dictated by the Articles of Confederation which required a unanimous vote of all the states. Instead, Article VII called for approval by just nine of the 13 states. a two-thirds majority.[49][15][50]

	Two factions soon emerged, one supporting the Constitution, the Federalists, and the other opposing it, the so-called Anti-Federalists.[51][52] Over the ensuing months, the proposal was debated, criticized, and expounded upon clause by
	clause. In the state of New York, at the time a hotbed of anti-Federalism, three delegates from the Philadelphia Convention who were also members of the Congress—Hamilton, Madison, and Jay—published a series of commentaries, now known as The
	Federalist Papers, in support of ratification.[53][54]

	Before the year's end, two state legislatures voted in favor of ratification. Delaware was first with a unanimous 30-0 vote and Pennsylvania second, approving the measure 46-23.[55][56][57] As 1788 began, New Jersey and Georgia followed
	Delaware's lead with unanimous votes, but the outcome became less certain as leaders in key states such as Virginia, New York, and Massachusetts expressed concerns over the lack of protections for people's rights.[58][59][60][61] Fearing the
	prospect of defeat, the Federalists relented, promising that if the Constitution was adopted, amendments would be added to secure individual liberties.[62] With that, the anti-Federalists' position collapsed.[63]

	On June 21, 1788, New Hampshire became the ninth state to ratify. Three months later, on September 17, Congress adopted the Constitution as the law of the land. It then passed resolutions setting dates for choosing the first senators and
	representatives, the first Wednesday of January (January 7, 1789); electing the first president, the first Wednesday of February (February 4); and officially starting the new government, the first Wednesday of March (March 4), when the first
	Congress would convene.[64] As its final act, the Congress of Confederation agreed to purchase 10 square miles from Maryland and Virginia for establishing a permanent capital.</p>
