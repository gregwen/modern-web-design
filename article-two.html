    <summary>Article II</summary>
    <p>Article II describes the office, qualifications, and duties of the President of the United States
        and the
        Vice President. The President is head of the executive branch of the federal government, as well
        as the
        nation's head of state and head of government.</p>

    <p>Article two is modified by the 12th Amendment which tacitly acknowledges political parties, and
        the 25th
        Amendment relating to office succession. The president is to receive only one compensation from
        the federal
        government. The inaugural oath is specified to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.
    </p>

    <p>The president is the Commander in Chief of the United States Armed Forces, as well as of state
        militias when
        they are mobilized. The president makes treaties with the advice and consent of a two-thirds
        quorum of the
        Senate. To administer the federal government, the president commissions all the offices of the
        federal
        government as Congress directs; and may require the opinions of its principal officers and make
        "recess
        appointments" for vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate. The president
        ensures the laws
        are faithfully executed and may grant reprieves and pardons with the exception of Congressional
        impeachment.
        The president reports to Congress on the State of the Union, and by the Recommendation Clause,
        recommends
        "necessary and expedient" national measures. The president may convene and adjourn Congress
        under special
        circumstances.</p>

    <p>Section 4 provides for the removal of the president and other federal officers. The president is
        removed on
        impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.</p>

            <p><strong>The Constitution of the United States</strong> is the supreme law of the United States of
                America. It
                superseded the <em>Articles of Confederation</em>, the nation's first constitution, in 1789. Originally
                comprising seven articles, it delineates the national frame and constraints of government. Its first
                three
                articles embody the doctrine of the separation of powers, whereby the federal government is divided into
                three branches:</p>

            <ul>
                <li class="navigation">Article 1: Legislative Branch</li>
                <li class="navigation">Article 2: Executive Branch</li>
                <li class="navigation">Article 3: Judicial Branch</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Article IV, Article V, and Article VI embody concepts of federalism, describing the rights and
                responsibilities of state governments, the states in relationship to the federal government, and the
                shared
                process of constitutional amendment. Article VII establishes the procedure subsequently used by the 13
                states to ratify it. The Constitution of the United States is the oldest and longest-standing written
                and
                codified national constitution in force in the world today.</p>

            </aside>

            <p>Since the constitution was ratified in 1789, it has been amended 27 times. The first ten amendments,
                known
                collectively as the Bill of Rights, offer specific protections of individual liberty and justice and
                place
                restrictions on the powers of government within the U.S. states. The majority of the 17 later amendments
                expand individual civil rights protections. Others address issues related to federal authority or modify
                government processes and procedures. Amendments to the United States Constitution, unlike ones made to
                many
                constitutions worldwide, are appended to the document.</p>

            <p>The original U.S. Constitution was written on five pages of parchment. The first permanent constitution,
                it
                is interpreted, supplemented, and implemented by a large body of federal constitutional law, and has
                influenced the constitutions of other nations.</p>
